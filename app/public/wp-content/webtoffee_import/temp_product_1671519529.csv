ezviz-c1c-b-smart-wi-fi-indoor-camera;Ezviz C1C-B Smart Wi-Fi Indoor Camera;"
Introducing 2021 All New EZVIZ C1C-B Indoor Camera


Keep your home fully secured.


The C1C-B, a compact WiFi camera from EZVIZ, records sweet moments, protects your family, and keeps you updated on what‘s happening at home when you’re away. It’s small enough to be placed almost anywhere, and its simple DIY installation design lets you easily configure this camera for the best possible performance.



Clarity as always.


This camera performs brilliantly regardless of hourly changes in light and shadow. Advanced, built-in infrared LEDs ensure a 12-meter full-HD night vision range, helping you capture incredible low-light shots without creating light pollution.


Always in the know.

No more staring at the screen to look through everything and every moment – we’re here to take the shift for you. You can rest assured with the help of the EZVIZ App, as automatic alerts will be sent to you on any suspicious activity captured on camera.



User-friendly audio alerts.


This camera also comes with three audio alert modes when motion is detected – silent, short beep, and siren. Want to hear your visitors while you are in another room? Set the camera on siren mode so you will hear the alert loud and clear.



Records only when you want it to.


The C1C-B camera provides a flexible option for you to record – or not – whenever you think it’s necessary. You can manually activate the Sleep Mode with a tap on your phone, at which you won’t receive notifications and real-time recording will pause.



Two-way audio.


With the C1C-B, you can talk to your child, pet or other family members right on your phone while you’re away.


Compact and thoughtful design.

A magnetic base and clever mounting kit make installation a breeze. Mount this camera by attaching it to any magnetic surface, or use the kit to attach it to a wall or ceiling – and you are all set. Its upgraded positioning stem on the base also makes it more flexible – so you get the exact viewing angle that you need.



H.265 video technology.


The camera features the advanced H.265 video compression technology, achieving better video quality using only half the bandwidth and half the storage space of the previous video compression standard (H.264).



We protect your data and privacy.


Protecting your data and privacy is our highest priority. Data transmission between the camera and the EZVIZ Cloud is encrypted from end to end. Only you have the keys to decrypt your data. To get an extra layer of privacy protection, you can always enable the camera’s sleep mode on the EZVIZ App.




Security at your fingertips.



With the EZVIZ App, you can capture, save, protect, and share what’s valuable to you.


Storage of footage
EZVIZ cameras can hold a MicroSD card (up to 256 GB) for local continuous storage upon each detection, or alternatively you can sign up to our Cloud Storage system (subject to subscription costs).
Works with EZVIZ Alarm Systems
Link to a specific EZVIZ alarm sensor via the app to ensure footage begins straight away when a sensor is triggered, helping capture the whole event from all angles.

Overview


If your concern is not only about home security but about using motion to turn on or off the light, well, SONOFF SNZB-03 maybe makes you feel amazing.
This ZB motion sensor is an extra-handy smart device for placing anywhere in your home to detect motion and trigger alarms. That means the sensor will send an instant alert notification to your mobile phone whenever the motion is detected if this security system is armed. If you have a SONOFF ZBBridge, you can connect the sensor to it to activate Wi-Fi devices, not merely ZB devices. For example, you can set a scene for your living-room light so that it will automatically turn on when you walk through the living-room.

homekit-box-lite;Homekit Box-Lite;"**Please note if you add on IP or RTSP Camera feeds this will slow down the HomeKit Bridge Lite. if you wish to bring in IP/RTSP cameras please look at HomeKit Bridge** 
HomeBridge is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. It supports Plugins, which are community-contributed modules that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers of ""smart home"" devices.
This is a complete unit that allows you to bring items from Ewelink, Smart Life, Tuya and other popular smart home apps into Apple HomeKit. Take control through one app and set times and control your home fully. The unit connects to your home network via Wi-fi and then you can log into the device and load some details and this will then bring through your devices from Ewelink, Smart Life, Tuya into HomeKit.
There is a simple website to log into to make changes and log into the plugin and add in additional Plugins if needed. From time to time the plugins do require an update and this can all be managed from the simple website
You can even use Siri to do the commands through your apple watch, iPhone, iPad, HomePod or Siri remote.
Add on devices sold through SystemGo for items like taking control of your Electric Gate or Garage Motor and Siri can action all while you are driving to your property. All items sold on System Go like Sonoff, Tuya/SmartLife, Eachen, Shelly, Broadlink all will work in HomeKit.
The only requirement for all to operate is a HomePod, Apple TV 4th Gen and above or iPad. This is the hub/gateway for all to operate your home when you not home.";2022/06/07;2022/09/28;Eiferer_ZA;;"Apple Home Bridge

sonoff-dualr2-wifi-wireless-smart-switch;Sonoff DualR2;"Overview
Sonoff Dual is a WiFi based 2 gang switch that can connect and independently control two connected appliances or lights. This simply means 1 Sonoff Dual control switch equals to 2 Sonoff basic switches! Sonoff Dual 2 gang light switch inherits Sonoff Basic switch’s advantages such as easy installation and operation, quick WiFi access, remote control through APP EweLink.
In the application eWeLink, available on both iOS and Android, users can independently turn on/off each of the two connected devices. But the button on Sonoff Dual 2 gang WiFi light switch is not an ON/OFF toggle switch, it is only a WiFi pairing button. Users can set single/repeat/countdown timing schedules to turn on/off at a specified time, and also share with others so that they can control together.

homekit-box;Homekit Box;"HomeBridge is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. It supports Plugins, which are community-contributed modules that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers of ""smart home"" devices.
This is a complete unit that allows you to bring items from Ewelink, Smart Life, Tuya and other popular smart home apps into Apple HomeKit. Take control through one app and set times and control your home fully. The unit plugs into the ethernet port of your router within your home and then you can log into the device and load some details and this will then bring through your devices from Ewelink, Smart Life, Tuya into HomeKit.
There is a simple website to log into to make changes and log into the plugin and add in additional Plugins if needed. From time to time the plugins do require an update and this can all be managed from the simple website
You can even use Siri to do the commands through your apple watch, iPhone, iPad, HomePod or Siri remote.
Add on devices sold through Eiferer for items like taking control of your Electric Gate or Garage Motor and Siri can action all while you are driving to your property. You have the ability to add in IP cameras too that will pull through to HomeKit so now you can control your home and check on  your cameras too. All items sold on Eiferer like Sonoff, Tuya/SmartLife, Eachen, Shelly, Broadlink all will work in HomeKit.
The only requirement for all to operate is a HomePod, Apple TV 4th Gen and above or iPad. This is the hub/gateway for all to operate your home when you not home.

ri3-motion-sensor;PIR3-RF - 433MHZ RF PIR motion sensor;"Overview

SONOFF PIR3-RF Decriptions:
The difference with SONOFF PIR2 RF motion sensor is that PIR3-RF has a small and compact size, easy to be used in almost any position to detect the movement.
SONOFF PIR3-RF motion sensor can detect and report motion. When used for your home security system, it can detect the movement within 8M and help identify whether a human or pet is moving around inside your house, and your mobile phone will receive an alert notification. Connect SONOFF camera and you can view who is the intruder. When incorporated into your smart lifestyle, the sensor triggers your light on or off after connecting with SONOFF RF Bridge. You can set a scene that the hallway light is turned on when you enter the door.
With the universal joint, the sensor can be flexible to rotate a full 360°horizontal angle and 90°vertical angle which allows you to adjust the sensor into an optimal angle to view everything in your home (The sensor doesn’t move on its own based on your motion). Another convenience for your home is that you can use the sensor for a position where the movement is not easy to be detected via mounting it in the universal joint, and just rotate the universal joint head to get a wonderful detecting angle. Plus, you can directly stick the sensor on the surface of objects to detect the movement. Just choose one as you like.
PIR3-RF has 2 working modes that alert and normal mode. In the alert mode, the sensor is triggered per 5s when someone enters the detection range. In the normal mode, the next alert trigger is activated if there is no motion detected within 1min after the previous detection.
Note:1. The PIR3-RF sensor requires SONOFF 433MHz RF Bridge to work.2. The universal joint is not included, please purchase it separately.
